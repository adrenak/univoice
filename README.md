# UniVoice
UniVoice is a voice chat/VoIP solution for Unity.
  
Some features of UniVoice:
- üë• Group voice chat. Multiple peers can join a chatroom and exchange audio.  

- ‚öô Peer specific settings. Don't want to listen to a peer? Mute them. Don't want someone listening to you? Mute yourself against them.
 
- üé® Customize your audio input, output and networking layer. 
  * üé§ __Configurable Audio Input__: UniVoice is audio input agnostic. It supports mic audio input out of the box and you can change the source of outgoing audio by implementing the `IAudioInput` interrace.  
    
  * üîä __Configurable Audio Output__:  UniVoice is audio output agnostic. Out of the box is supports playing peer audio using Unity AudioSource. You can divert incoming audio to anywhere you want by implementing the `IAudioOutput` interface.  

  * üåê __Configurable Network__: UniVoice is network agnostic and supports Mirror out of the box. You can implement the `IAudioClient` and `IAudioServer` interfaces using the networking plugin of your choice to make it compatible with it.
