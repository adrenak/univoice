Let it be from Unity's Microphone class, or a live streaming audio, or an MP4 file on the disk. 🔊 Configurable Audio Output : Decide where the incoming peer audio goes. Let the output of incoming audio be Unity AudioSource to play the audio in-game, or write it into an MP4 on the disk, or stream it to an online service. 🌐 Configurable Network : Want to use UniVoice in a WLAN project using Telepathy? Just adapt its API for UniVoice with a simple the IChatroomNetwork interface. Using your own backend for multiplayer? Create and expose your audio API and write a UniVoice implementation, again with the same interface. 📦 Provides out-of-the-box implementation for audio input, output and networking. Just run the group chat sample in Unity. UniVoice comes packaged with: 🎤 Audio Input : based on UniMic which sends your microphone input over the network. 🔊 Audio Output : source that plays incoming peer audio on Unity AudioSource 🌐 P2P network : implementation based on AirPeer which uses WebRTC for free-of-cost networking between peers. Plus, to get started you don't need to worry about hosting your own WebRTC signalling server as a server that's good enough for testing is already available. (See the project samples for more details) *signalling server costs still apply, but they are minimal and sometimes free on platforms such as Heroku Documentation For the API documentation, please visit http://www.vatsalambastha.com/univoice Manuals, Wiki, Tutorials, etc. are not available yet. Usage Creating a chatroom agent To be able to host and join voice chatrooms, you need a ChatroomAgent instance. To get the ready-to-use inbuilt implementation, use this var agent = new InbuiltChatroomAgentFactory(SIGNALLING_SERVER_URL).Create(); // Don't worry, a signalling server URL is available inside the repositories samples code. Hosting and joining chatrooms Every peer in the chatroom is assigned an ID by the host. And every peer has a peer list, representing the other peers in the chatroom. To get your ID agent.ID; ChatroomAgent exposes Network , an implementation of IChatroomNetwork To get a list of the other peers in the chatroom, use this: agent.Network.Peers agent.Network also provides methods to host or join a chatroom. Here is how you use them: // Host a chatroom using a name agent.Network.HostChatroom(\"ROOM_NAME\"); // Join an existing chatroom using a name agent.Network.JoinChatroom(\"ROOM_NAME\"); // Leave the chatroom, if connected to one agent.Network.LeaveChatroom(); // Closes a chatroom, if was hosting one agent.Network.CloseChatroom(); Muting Audio To mute everyone in the chatroom, use agent.MuteOthers = true; or set it to false to unmute them all. To mute yourself use agent.MuteSelf = true; or set it to false to unmute yourself. This will stop sending your audio to all the peers in the chatroom. For muting a specific peer, first get the peers settings object using this: var settings = agent.PeerSettings[id]; // where id belongs to the peer in question settings.muteThem = true; If you want to mute yourself towards a specific peer, use this: var settings = agent.PeerSettings[id]; // where id belongs to the peer in question settings.muteSelf = true; Events agent.Network provides several network related events. Refer to the API reference for them. Known Issues UniVoice is based on AirPeer which currently has an issue where peers on different networks are often unable to connect. Eg. two mobile phone in different geographical locations are trying to have a voice chat. Both are connected to their respective WiFi. One hosts and waits for the other. The one trying to join may fail and only succeed when the connection is changed from its Wifi to cellular data. This issue will be addressed inside AirPeer itself. For more see the 'Connectivity issues' section at the AirPeer Homepage Alternatively, a Unity WebRTC based implementation of UniVoice's network interface may be directly introduced. In either case, there a need to have a newer underlying networking solution. License and Support This project under the MIT license .
