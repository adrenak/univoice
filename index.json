UniVoice UniVoice is a voice chat/VoIP solution for Unity. Some features of UniVoice: 👥 Group voice chat. Multiple peers can join a chatroom and exchange audio. ⚙ Peer specific settings. Don't want to listen to a peer? Mute them. Don't want someone listening to you? Mute yourself against them. 🎨 Customize your audio input, output and networking layer. 🎤 Configurable Audio Input : Decide what the input of your outgoing audio is. Let it be from Unity's Microphone class, or a live streaming audio, or an MP4 file on the disk. 🔊 Configurable Audio Output : Decide where the incoming peer audio goes. Let the output of incoming audio be Unity AudioSource to play the audio in-game, or write it into an MP4 on the disk, or stream it to an online service. 🌐 Configurable Network : Want to use UniVoice in a WLAN project using Telepathy? Just adapt its API for UniVoice with a simple the IChatroomNetwork interface. Using your own backend for multiplayer? Create and expose your audio API and write a UniVoice implementation, again with the same interface. Docs Manuals and sample projects are not available yet. For the API reference, please visit http://www.vatsalambastha.com/univoice Usage Creating a chatroom agent To be able to host and join voice chatrooms, you need a ChatroomAgent instance. var agent = new ChatroomAgent(IChatroomNetwork network, IAudioInput audioInput, IAudioOutput audioOutput); Hosting and joining chatrooms Every peer in the chatroom is assigned an ID by the host. And every peer has a peer list, representing the other peers in the chatroom. To get your ID agent.Network.OwnID; To get a list of the other peers in the chatroom, use this: agent.Network.PeersIDs agent.Network also provides methods to host or join a chatroom. Here is how you use them: // Host a chatroom using a name agent.Network.HostChatroom(optional_data); // Join an existing chatroom using a name agent.Network.JoinChatroom(optional_data); // Leave the chatroom, if connected to one agent.Network.LeaveChatroom(optional_data); // Closes a chatroom, if is hosting one agent.Network.CloseChatroom(optional_data); Muting Audio To mute everyone in the chatroom, use agent.MuteOthers = true; or set it to false to unmute them all. To mute yourself use agent.MuteSelf = true; or set it to false to unmute yourself. This will stop sending your audio to all the peers in the chatroom. For muting a specific peer, first get the peers settings object using this: agent.PeerSettings[id].muteThem = true; // where id belongs to the peer in question If you want to mute yourself towards a specific peer, use this: agent.PeerSettings[id].muteSelf = true; // where id belongs to the peer in question Events agent.Network provides several network related events.
